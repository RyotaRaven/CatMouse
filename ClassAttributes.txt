Mice:
    -Start with 3(?) Mice
    -15 units speed
    -2units breeding delay
    -life timer
    -hunger timer
    -inputs:
	*where is closest cheese?
	*where is cat?
    -fills up cat hunger timer

Cat:
    -Start with 2(?) Cats
    -10 units speed
    -4 units breeding delay
    -life timer
    -hunger timer
    -inputs:
	*where is closest mouse?
Cheese:
    -spawns by timer in random location
    -x/y locatoin
    -doesnt move
    -refills mouse hunger timer


--Project Ideas--
    -Cat and Mouse meet
	*mouse dies
	*cat timer reset
    -Mouse meets cheese
	*mouse timer reset
	*cheese disappears
    -Mouse meets Mouse/ Cat meets Cat
	*Breed - one new child appears
	*Crossover of parents evolution with X% 
	*Breeding delay
    -Possible timer uses
	*timer runs out = DEATH
	*timer at certain point = don't breed seek food


--Maybe--
    -Red X for death
    -eating slows for a limited time (they sleep after eating and don't move)
    -possible mouse hole implimentation
    -if two cats encounter mouse at the same time they could fight (maybe)
    -Genders?
	*same gender meeting = fighting
	*different gender = breeding
    -narrative
    -GUI sliders
