						--A note on ideas for implimentations of our....ideas--
	-breeding timer can be a boolean and a counter combination and when they breed the counter goes to two and sets the boolean canBreed to false,
	then if canBreed is false we decrement the counter and check if its 0 and if its 0 we reset canBreed to true.
	-outputs for mice/cats is they can move left, right, up, or down by their velocity. (or diagonally).
	-can output a list that is like [#ofMice, MiceLongestLife, #ofCats, CatsLongestLife] to see all of the performances and we just know where each
	is in order to determine fitnesses. 
	-exit the game after three minutes, then mutate the brains of the lowest fitness group? ideally each cat has its own neural network...i would think.
