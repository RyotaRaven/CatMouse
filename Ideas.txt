						--A note on ideas for implimentations of our....ideas--
	-breeding timer can be a boolean and a counter combination and when they breed the counter goes to two and sets the boolean canBreed to false,
	then if canBreed is false we decrement the counter and check if its 0 and if its 0 we reset canBreed to true.
	-outputs for mice/cats is they can move left, right, up, or down by their velocity. (or diagonally).
	-can output a list that is like [#ofMice, MiceLongestLife, #ofCats, CatsLongestLife] to see all of the performances and we just know where each
	is in order to determine fitnesses. 
	-exit the game after three minutes, then mutate the brains of the lowest fitness group? ideally each cat has its own neural network...i would think.
	-same counting method could be used for other timers.....a counter that counts down after each frame and then when they eat it adds to the timer and/or
	is completely refilled and we can use its value to check if they can breed or not. like if(hunger>=??and canBreed): this one boolean can also keep track
	of when its too hungry to breed


								--Current Goals--
	-set up a file to do the neuroevolution=>focus on getting rats to work first


								--Current Issues--
	-Banner's a fatty
	-It seems like every time i run they appear in the same random locations on the screen...hmm...
	-Not sure how to generalize the nueral network to take a different amount of inputs for the cat and mouse. we may need to have....seperate
	files...but also that maybe each cat/mouse has their own not sure how to impliment that either instead of them all having the same though
	for now that may be easier im not sure if that could do individual outputs they would move in mass....idk D:s
